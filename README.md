> I'm a nineteen-years-old full stack developer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª. I got into the programming world almost five years ago and I've been learning and applying that new knowledge ever since. See my [16personalities profile here!](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3ede20010c15e)

##  Hard Skills üìö

I have exposed myself to a wide variety of languages such as `Java, Python, SQL and JavaScript`. This way, I can read almost any code I see and truly _understand what is happening_.

I would be prone to say that my **analytical thinking**, my **pattern recognition skills** and my **algorithmic-based reasoning** are very useful when I have the need to learn and/or adapt to a new programming environment.

Specifically, I know:

##  Soft skills ü•≥

I would describe myself as a very extroverted person, never afraid of speaking up when something goes wrong, and with high communicative skills, willing to step up to any challenge that may arise.

I am really great at explaining complex matters in the simplest way so even people who might not be remotely close to my area of expertise are able to understand what I am talking about (e.g., parents, friends, coaches). You could say I adapt quickly to my environment.
