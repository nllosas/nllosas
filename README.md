> I'm a twenty-four-year-old full-stack developer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª from Argentina. I've always been interested in tech. I started my career in Computer Engineering in 2017 to persue my goal to have a space to pour my creative ideas into real life proyects through the medium of programming. In college I learned a lot of the principles of programming and continue to do so. In august of 2022 I made a big jump in my knowledge by taking part in the Henry FullStack developer Bootcamp, where I was tought the PERN Stack to make SPA aplications, and where I partook in the PawsFounding Proyect.

##  Hard Skills üìö

I have learned a wide variety of programming languages over the years, some in my college career and some in the Henry Bootcamp. Here I list the languages that I feel most comfortable with: `C, Python, SQL, Typescript and JavaScript`.
This is a great thing because it lets me read almost any code I see and truly _understand what is happening_.

I'm excited to start applying my programming skills in a workplace environment, where my ***problem-solving*** and my ***agile learning*** skills will fully bloom.

Specifically, I know:
